#### This is a self-learn / self-trial project as I can't put Docker + Gulp + BrowserSync work together.

Clone this project and open it from VSCode would work perfectly!

### Step of execution

1. Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) & [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) if you havn't
2. Install VSCode plugins [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) by Microsoft
3. Open this project by VSCode
4. Click the 'Open a remote window' or press 'F1' and select 'Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container' and select this project folder
5. VSCode will pull 'node' from Docker Hub and take a few minutes to download & setup
6. Once the container is ready, run 'gulp' to start the node server or click 'gulp' under 'NPM SCRIPTS' section
7. Open [Dummy page](http://127.0.0.1:5000) and make some change on app.js
8. Enjoy ~~~
